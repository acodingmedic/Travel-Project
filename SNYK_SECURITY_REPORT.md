## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Critical/High Priority)

1. **Upgrade multer package** (Fixes 4 vulnerabilities)
   ```bash
   npm install multer@2.0.2
   ```

2. **Update react-scripts** (Addresses multiple indirect dependencies)
   ```bash
   npm install react-scripts@latest
   ```

### Infrastructure Security Assessment

- **IaC Scan Status:** Failed due to node_modules conflicts
- **Container Scan Status:** Requires built Docker image
- **Code Scan Status:** Failed to retrieve output

### Recommendations

#### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Immediately upgrade multer to resolve critical vulnerability
2. Update react-scripts to latest stable version
3. Test application thoroughly after updates
4. Re-run Snyk scan to verify fixes

#### Medium-term (1 month)
1. Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Set up Snyk monitoring for continuous vulnerability detection
3. Establish security review process for new dependencies
4. Create Docker image and run container security scan

#### Long-term (Ongoing)
1. Regular security audits (monthly)
2. Keep dependencies updated with automated tools
3. Implement security-first development practices
4. Monitor Snyk security advisories

## Security Posture Assessment

**Current Risk Level:** HIGH
- Critical vulnerability in file upload functionality
- Multiple high-severity issues in development dependencies
- Potential for DoS attacks and XSS vulnerabilities

**Post-Remediation Risk Level:** MEDIUM-LOW
- After applying recommended fixes, risk significantly reduced
- Remaining medium-severity issues manageable with monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Execute immediate remediation** for critical multer vulnerability
2. **Update react-scripts** to resolve indirect dependency issues
3. **Re-scan with Snyk** to verify vulnerability resolution
4. **Implement continuous monitoring** for future security issues
5. **Document security procedures** for development team

## Compliance Notes

- All identified vulnerabilities have public CVE identifiers
- Remediation paths available for 8 out of 10 vulnerabilities
- 2 vulnerabilities require indirect dependency updates
- No vulnerabilities currently without available fixes
